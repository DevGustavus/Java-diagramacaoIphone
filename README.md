<h1 align="center">iPhone layout:</h1>

## ðŸ“– About the project
In this project, developed using the Java language, I implemented basic inputs with validations. These inputs result in an output, which is a fully constructed iPhone object with its information. <br>
However, towards the end, we have a menu built with "switch cases" and loops. This menu provides action options to the user. Nevertheless, this basic challenge is part of a DIO Bootcamp: Santander Bootcamp | Fullstack Developer.
